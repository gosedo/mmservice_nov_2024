Maintenance Management Service (MMService)

This is one of the microservices that is planned to be included in the whole system that will serve as a property management system.
The Property management system will have Maintenance Management Service, Inventory Management Service, Contract/Lease Management Service and Billing Service.

MMService at the current implementation stage (which is done for capstone) just has the feature necessary to meet the capstone requirement. 
But when the whole project gets completed, it will have more features and gives more services than what it has at this moment.

Technical Implementation
==========================
Spring Boot REST API and Angular are used as back end and front end technology to implement the MMService.

Spring Boot REST API
======================
This is the back end of the MMService application.
It is composed of the following packages.

Com.mmssystem.property –> the root package with the main spring boot application class and custom configuration class.

Com.mmssystem.property.controller –> the controllers for REST APIs package

			AuthenticationController – The login functionality of the API.
			=======================
			A request to baseurl/api/auth/signin goes through spring security for authentication. Once authentication done and security context set, it will be allowed to access this API. In this the API, jwt bearer token will be generated based on the username/email and security key, and a response will be composed as AuthInformationDTO which has user information and token and token expiration date. Clients have to provide the bearer token in order to access resources which are set only for authorized clients.
			 
			MmsIssueController 
			=================== 
			/***
			* Maintenance Issue related service request will be handled with this controller.
			* will be able to create, select, update issues. Paged requests and responses are handled
			* 
			* */
			
			MmsTechTaskController – 
			====================
			/**
			* Task related request and response handled here.
			* create, select, update and delete request and response
			* 
			* */
			
			
			StaticDataController -
			=====================
			/**
			* This just for angular client application to provide static data/non frequent changing data
			* so that the angular application don't have to make multiple trip to the api to get non changing data. 
			* */
			UserController
			==============
			/**
			* User related request and response are handled here.
			* create, select, update and delete can be handled her.
			* */
			


Com.mmssystem.property.dto – the data transfer objects package

			The purpose of these object are just to transfer data between clients and the service layer. Sample dtos
			AuthInformationDTO
			=================
			/**
			* Used as transfer object by the authentication controller to send response with bearer token and user information
			* */
			MmsIssueCreateDTO
			==================
			/**
			* Used to take information necessary to create maintenance issue request by the tenant
			* */
			MmsIssueUpdateDTO
			================
			/**
			*Used to take information necessary to update maintenance issue request 
			* 
			* */
			MmsTechTaskCreateDTO
			===================
			/**
			*Used to take in the necessary information to create tasks 
			* */
			MmsUserActivationDTO
			====================
			
			/**
			* Used to take in user new password change information for activation
			* */


Com.mmssystem.property.exception – global exception handling and related classes

			MmsCustomError
			=============
			/**
			* This will be the response body for errors and exceptions
			* It has the time error occurred, the type Http Status we want to send the client
			* and the custom messaged/ application related messages can be included 
			* Validation errors list can be included.
			* */
			MmsCustomResponseBuilder
			=======================
			/**
			* This just custom builder not to repeat the creation of new ReponseEntity object everywhere.
			* */
			
			MmsGlobalExceptionHandler
			========================
			/**
			* This is a global exception handler to centralize the exception handling in spring boot application.
			* Help us have a generic exception handlers but message are localized to make them specific and
			* application related. And also have control the type of http status that will be in response.
			* 
			* */
			ResourceAlreadyExistsException
			============================
			
			/**
			* This is a generic exception that we can use where ever we want to give application specific 
			* exception information for users attempting to create the resources already in the system
			* The message can be customized as per the resources.
			* */
			ResourceNotFoundException
			========================
			/**
			* This is a generic exception that we can use whereever we want to give application specific 
			* exception information for users attempting to modify/do anything on non existing resources.
			* The message can be customized as per the resources.
			* */


Com.mmssystem.property.mapper – MapStruct is being used to map entities and dto. Below sample mappers.

			====================
			/**
			* MmsIssueStatus <-> MmsIssueStatusDTO mapper 
			* */

			* method of the user detail service for authentication.
			* 
			* */
			CustomAuthenticationProvider
			============================
			/**
			* This bean presents itself as provider so that the authentication manager will use it 
			* as authentication provider. As AuthManger provided by spring boot which will be used by 
			* the custom filter will go through possible candidates of auth provide which this is one of them.
			* authenticate method uses loadUserByUsername()of user detail service to get user password
			* and matches with the incoming one, if equal, returns Authentication object
			* 
			* */
			CustomTokenFilter
			=================
			/**
			* This custom filter when added to the filter list it will be responsible for security
			* related actions.
			* It handles basic and bearer token authentication. If basic authentication it extract user information base64
			* token and do authentication. If bearer token it checks the validity of the token. And then set the security context 
			* with authenticate. The security context will be used for the authorization of access to the resources.
			* */

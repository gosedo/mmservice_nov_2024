Issue: trying to create wrong user posting from postman was returning 401 unauthorized response. 
Diagnosis: No information was shown in the console as an issue but unauthorized response in postman.
exception/warning supposed to be shown for mapping issue between the user object sent and the expected object type.
reason: was using log4j2 custom logger rather than the default logger
solution: testing by removing the dependency of log4j2 and seeing the exception/warn of mapping issue in the console.

Issue: Date vs TimeStamp JPA
Solution: https://vladmihalcea.com/date-timestamp-jpa-hibernate/
Compared to java.util.Date or its JDBC counterparts, the Java Date/Time API offers is much easier to use and doesnâ€™t require any utility methods as the provided factory methods are very easy to use:

UserAccount user = new UserAccount()
    .setId(1L)
    .setFirstName("Vlad")
    .setLastName("Mihalcea")
    .setSubscribedOn(
        LocalDate.of(
            2013, 9, 29
        )
    );
	

Issue: Hibernate was generating tables with relationships but the foriegnKey was not created for the tables.
		when DB was generated for mysql the engine was defaulted MyISAM. MyISAM doesn't have concept of FK.
		For FK Generation engine = InnoDB 
Reason:Hibernate was configured hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect 
Solution: Changed to hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect

///////Authentication functionality being added using spring-security.Spring auto generated the following password for development envi only

//In the Hackton the UserPJO and Project 
//Still trying to figure it out if both ther userservice and project service are using the same session.
//Both were pulled from the database using two different services and repositories
//user exists in db but project is new. I assigned the project's user property with the user from database which was pulled using a different 
//service and repository. when I saved the project, the project was saved to the db with the userid the project belongs to.
//me now trying to figure out what spring is doing as project is transient and user persistent state probably from different session
//get saved with out duplicating or giving error.
//The question is do two different repositories have/use the same session ?


For CustomUserDetailsService
===============================
problem: I was using user repository directly to get user information and exception was thrown as session doesn't exist
Solution: using the userservice which has session and uses the the user repository  

Securing requestMatchers("api/issue/mmsissue-list").authenticated()
======================
With permitAll it was working fine but when changed to authenticated() it was not even checking the custom filter.
The Customfilter can be debuged as with permitAll but not when changed to authenicated().
Solution: AddFilterBefore 
 http.addFilterBefore( new CustomRequestHeaderTokenFilter(authenticationConfiguration.getAuthenticationManager()), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);
 
 Incorrect Url
 ===============
 Had a hardtime with the issue related to the incorrect url getting unauthorized While the jwt works fine.
 Later figured it ouy it was incorrect url. before "/auth/signin" in the config but supposed to be "api/auth/signin".
 "api/auth" on the controller and "auth/signin" on the method changed to "/signin" on the method.
 
 Incorrect CascadeType on MmsUser PERSIST
 =====================================
 org.hibernate.PersistentObjectException: detached entity passed to persist: com.mmsystem.property.model.MmsUserRole
 solution: PERSIST was used on the roles filed of the MmsUser class, which will try to persist existing role.
 removing CascadeType.PERSIST enabled me persist MmsUser to the database : resolved
  
  403 Forbiden issue because of Cors
  ==================================

  http.cors();
  http.csrf().disable();

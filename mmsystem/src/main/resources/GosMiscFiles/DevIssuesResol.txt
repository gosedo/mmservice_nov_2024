Issue: Date vs TimeStamp JPA
Solution: https://vladmihalcea.com/date-timestamp-jpa-hibernate/
Compared to java.util.Date or its JDBC counterparts, the Java Date/Time API offers is much easier to use and doesnâ€™t require any utility methods as the provided factory methods are very easy to use:

UserAccount user = new UserAccount()
    .setId(1L)
    .setFirstName("Vlad")
    .setLastName("Mihalcea")
    .setSubscribedOn(
        LocalDate.of(
            2013, 9, 29
        )
    );
	

Issue: Hibernate was generating tables with relationships but the foriegnKey was not created for the tables.
		when DB was generated for mysql the engine was defaulted MyISAM. MyISAM doesn't have concept of FK.
		For FK Generation engine = InnoDB 
Reason:Hibernate was configured hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect 
Solution: Changed to hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
